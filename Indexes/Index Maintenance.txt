Indexes

Targeted Index Maintenance
 - reorganize any index where avg_fragmentation_in_percent is below 30% 
 - rebuilding any index where avg_fragmentation_in_percent is over 30%
	- online/offline?

 - rebuild associated non-clustered indexes (keyword all)?  When do we want to do this?



Other:

 - Index usage stats
 - missing indexes



Index Reads vs Writes?




use 'including' when creating clustered indexes
